							<p>Hi - my name is Bob and I am currently a junior at Tufts University in Somerville, MA studying 
								Computer Science through the school of Engineering and minoring in Entrepreneurship. Before Tufts, I 
								attended Phillips Academy Andover for boarding school. My good friend Ben and I started NESCAC GUIDE 
								to help as many students as we can get into their NESCAC dream schools. We offer many free services 
								and genuinely want to help you. If you're interested at all, shoot me an email at

								<p>Hi! My name is Ben and I am graduating from Bates in the Spring of 2022. In highschool, I struggled 
									to maintain good grades, and didnâ€™t have any amazing talents in sports or music. For much of my 
									senior year, I was worried about getting into any college - let alone a good one. Thankfully, I got 
									help from one of the best college counselors in the country, and was accepted in 14 out of my 15 
									applications. I've spent hundreds of hours researching the college admissions process and want to 
									share what I can. My friend Bob and I decided to start Nescac Guide for this very purpose, and are 
									excited to help. You can reach me personally at 
									<a href="mailto:nescacguide@gmail.com">baguilar@bates.edu</a>.</p>
