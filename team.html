							<p>Hi - my name is Bob and I am currently a junior at Tufts University in Somerville, MA studying 
								Computer Science through the school of Engineering and minoring in Entrepreneurship. Before Tufts, I 
								attended Phillips Academy Andover for boarding school. My good friend Ben and I started NESCAC GUIDE 
								to help as many students as we can get into their NESCAC dream schools. We offer many free services 
								and genuinely want to help you. If you're interested at all, shoot me an email at

								<p>Hi - my name is Ben and I am graduating from Bates in the Spring of 2022. In highschool, I struggled to maintain good grades, and didnâ€™t have any amazing talents like sports or music. At one point, I was wondering if I could get into any college at all. Thankfully, I got help from one of the best college counselors in the country, and was accepted to 14 out of 15 applications. I've spent hundreds of hours researching the college admissions process and am here to help. I decided to start NESCAC GUIDE for exactly that. Please contact me at baguilar@bates.edu</p>
