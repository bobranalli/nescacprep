			Top-tier liberal arts schools have long held the nickname of ‘The Little Ivys’. This term usually refers to elite schools 
			within the NESCAC, primarily: Amherst, Williams, Middlebury, Wesleyan, Hamilton, Tufts, Colby, Bates, and Bowdoin. The 
			implication here is that these small liberal arts colleges resemble the Ivy League Universities, both in terms of 
			competitiveness and caliber - despite undoubtedly being smaller and less recognized. 
			<br><br>
			Like most schools, the Little Ivys have been hitting record low admissions rates. Every single year, these prestigious 
			schools seem to be getting more and more competitive than they already were. When I was applying into Bates in 2018, the 
			admissions rate had plunged from 22% to 17% percent. Only a few years later, it is now closer to 10%. To put this into 
			perspective, Dartmouth College was 11% when I was applying to Bates.
			<br><br>
			The bottom line is, the Little Ivys are earning their title more than ever nowadays. If you are interested in these schools 
			- which I wouldn’t blame you for - you’re going to have to perfect your application to stand out against the overwhelming 
			competition. There are obviously plenty of resources for the Ivy League schools (e.g. Ivyleagueprep.com, Ivyacademic.com, 
			etc.) but what about for the smaller elites?
			<br><br>
			This is exactly what our team at NESCAC GUIDE is here to provide: information, resources, and genuine connections 
			specifically for NESCAC applicants. We are a growing community of recent alums and admissions specialists, and we cannot 
			wait to help you on your journey. We want to give away our best information for free, so please feel welcome to check out 
			our website's main resources, free of charge. This includes a first time essay review, where we will send you a 
			comprehensive report of our suggestions and comments. We know exactly what each of these schools are looking for, and the 
			personality conveyed in your essay is particularly vital for the small NESCAC schools.  
			<br><br>
			For those of you who are really set on getting into a specific school, we also  <a href="index.html#form-title" style ="text-decoration: underline";>have one-on-one counseling and application 
			workshops</a> through our school representatives. For more information, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at
