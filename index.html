					Nescac Guide is a resource for high school students interested in NESCAC colleges. The site is run by NESCAC 
					students and graduates, who you can connect with for advice and counseling.  As students who were once in your 
					shoes, we're here to help. We want students to get the same opportunities and experiences we were able to have.
					<br><br>
					Our student team also works closely with NESCAC faculty and college counselors from some of the best boarding 
					schools in the world, like Phillips Academy Andover. That said, Nescac Guide is not directly affiliated with the 
					official NESCAC organization or any specific schools.
					<br><br>
					Keep scrolling for more content that might be of use, and visit our <a href="reps.html">Connect Page</a> to get in 
					contact with a student who can help you on your application journey. Lastly, feel free to check out our 
					blogs on the NESCAC schools and their admission process.
