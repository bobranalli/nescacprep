					Nescac Guide is an admissions resource for high school students interested in NESCAC colleges. The site is run by 
					recent NESCAC graduates, all of whom are eager to connect with new applicants. As students who were once in your 
					shoes, we're here to help. We want to see ambitious students get the same opportunities and experiences we were 
					able to have. 
					<br><br>
					Our student team also works closely with NESCAC faculty and college counselors from some of the best boarding 
					schools in the world, like Phillips Academy Andover. That said, NescacGuide.com is not directly affiliated with the 
					official NESCAC organization or any of the schools within it.
					<br><br>
					We are more than happy to connect you to additional resources, and we are open to any suggestions from students and 
					parents. Keep scrolling for more content that might be of use, or visit our Team Page to meet the core members of 
					Nescac Guide, who can help you on your journey. Lastly, feel free to check out our blogs on the NESCAC schools and 
					their admission process.
